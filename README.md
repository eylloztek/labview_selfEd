## Details

### Fahrenheit to Celcius
In this training, a system that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius using SubVI in LabVIEW was developed. SubVI is something similar to a subroutine in the text based languages. In LabVIEW, a SubVI (Sub-Virtual Instrument) is a subroutine or subVI that is used within another VI (Virtual Instrument), usually performing a specific task. SubVIs help make the LabVIEW program more modular and reduce complexity. SubVIs can be very useful when it is necessary to use the same functionality multiple times, especially in large projects. Once a SubVI is created, you can use that VI elsewhere and unify the complexity, resulting in a more understandable programming environment.
